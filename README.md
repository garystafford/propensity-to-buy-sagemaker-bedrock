In this post, we will learn how to combine traditional machine learning models prepared, built, trained, and deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI with Amazon Nova, the latest state-of-the-art generative foundation models available on Amazon Bedrock. Using these AI and ML capabilities, we will predict and target consumers with a high propensity to purchase electronic products during the Holiday season. Although this post demonstrates text-based personalized digital marketing, the workflow can easily be extended to digital advertising, including using Amazon Nova Canvas and Amazon Nova Reel to incorporate generated images, videos, and other graphic elements.
